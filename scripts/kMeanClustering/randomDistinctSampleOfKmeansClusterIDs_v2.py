#	This program takes a SHP file and randomly selects a subset of features. The SHP file is required to have
#	a field called "cluster_id" and this field should have many duplicate values. This field is called on in 
#	the program to select the a sub set of features, and each feature is given a random number in a new field
#	called "rdmNum". Another new field is also created, "rep", which will be asigned a '1' to the feature with
# 	the lowest random value in the "rdmNum" field. Then all the features with a '1' value in the 'rep' field 
#	written to a new SHP file.
